    about what you are going to do next.\r\nSuddenly you notice a small abandoned
    hut which appears to be completely empty.Anyway, would you like to check it out
    or it seems\r\nbetter for you just to head straight into the dragon's loan?\r\nWhat
    should I do?\r\n\r\n1: Head to the cavern, I won't hestitate in front of\r\nthis
    tiny danger of miserable dragon\r\n\r\n2: It would be a better choise to check
    this hut\r\nanyway. Is won't consume too much time, but it would be a perfect
    start to find\r at least something useful"
