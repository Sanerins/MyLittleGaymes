The begining of the story:

You are a poor knight with brave heart who is standing in front of huge cave which is supposed to have a freaking dragon in it.
You are thinking about what you are going to do next. Suddenly you notice a small abandoned hut which appears to be completely empty.

Anyway, would you like to check it out or it seems better for you just to head straight into the dragon's loan?

What should I do?
1: Head to the cavern, I won't hestitate in front of this tiny danger of miserable dragon
2: It would be a better choise to check this hut anyway. Is won't consume too much time, but it would be a perfect start to find at least something useful
